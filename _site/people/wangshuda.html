<p>Careers and Legacy:</p>

<p>As a scholar, Wang is steeped in his knowledge on the origin and meaning of the Chinese characters. His research was venerated for it sensibility and rigor. Even during difficult times, he kept his life long love for reading and rare book collection. Many people who had been to his study marveled at the size of his collection. During the culture revolution, his house was stormed by the Red Guards. Most of his collections were taken away and scattered in society. He was only able to recoup a small portion of his collections after the Culture Revolution. Even so, Wang kept his habit of reading, studying and collecting until his death.</p>

<p>As an educator, Wang always led by example. He taught his students and younger generations with boundless kindness, patience and passion. He shared his knowledge generously and inspired his students in the common pursuit of knowledge which left a life long impression among many of his students.</p>

<p>As the head of a family, due to illness and early death of his father, Wang shouldered the responsibility of raising a big extended family, including his younger brothers. Through multiple wars, first the Japanese invasion during WWII, later the civil war, he financed the education of his younger brothers Wang Shuyi (王述羲, https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8E %8B%E8%BF%B0%E7%BE%B2) and Wang Zhimin (王志民, ). At the same time, he supported their pursuit of progressive thinking and the truth. As a young man, Wang Shuda was a loyal reader of “La Jeunesse” (新青年, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Youth). He took the responsibility of the country as his own, and thought that only through science and technology can one make bigger contributions to his/her country. All six of his children studied science and technology and graduated from top universities in China.</p>

<p>Anecdote</p>

<p>1、From Forever Yu Shizhi (于是之, https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%8E %E6%98%AF%E4%B9%8B)《永远的于是之》</p>

<p>Yu Shizhi:“In middle school，I dreamed of becoming a scholar, and would focus my study on Chinese Phonology. Chinese Phonology is so deep and profound，how can children understand it, but for teachers to know how to make it not only understandable but interesting. This intrigued me. I would admire the teacher’s knowledge and everything about them. I still see in my minds eye the study of my middle school teacher Wang Shankai. Books stacked up on all four sides, in the same styled glass doored bookshelves. The shelves were very tall, starting from the floor, reaching the ceiling. Teacher Wang taught me “Prelude to the meaning of words” ( 说文解字序) in this study – ‘‘古者，庖牺氏之王天下也’，‘王’，a verb here, pronounced with the fourth tone……’ In this fashion，he broke down the difficult sentences into components, talked about the origin of Chinese characters, and told me that it is not very believable that CangJie single handedly invented words: How can one person create all the words, why couldn’t other people create some too? ……Teacher Wang’s study didn’t seem to be very brightly lit, but the arrangements, even the postures and positions of the two of us sitting there when he was teaching, I still remember well. How fascinating, the study and the knowledgable owner of the study!”</p>

<p>2、From A national treasure who identifies treasures – Shi Shuqing《鉴宝终身的国宝级 大师–史树青》(http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%8F%B2%E6%A0%91%E9%9D%92)</p>

<p>In 1935, at 14 years of age, Shi Shuqing was admitted to the famous High School affiliated to Beijing Normal University. As the best school in Peking (Beijing), it has the best equipment, the best students – everybody is a born leader. Best of all are the teachers, such as the ones teaching Chinese, Mr Sun Zhao, Mr. Li Lianpo, and Mr. Wang Shuda. Everyone of them are masters of their field and skilled educators.</p>

<p>3、Du Xiaoqin (杜晓勤, https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%9C%E6%99%93%E5%8B %A4)《我在燕园住过的那些地儿》(陈平原主编《筒子楼的故事》)</p>

<p>has some descriptions of Wang Shuda:</p>

<p>I once spent less than 10 yuan to buy three Xuan Paper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuan_paper) note books with Wang Shuda’s signature on them. The note books are titled “ancient learning” (“国故”, https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9B%BD %E6%95%85%E5%AD%A6), “word origin” (“说文”, https://hanyu.baidu.com/zici/s?wd=%E8%AF %B4%E6%96%87&amp;query=%E2%80%9C%E8%AF %B4%E6%96%87%E2%80%9D&amp;srcid=28232&amp;from=kg0&amp;from=kg0), and “Anthology of ancient Chinese Writings” (“国故概要”, https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9B%BD %E6%95%85%E6%A6%82%E8%A6%81?forcehttps=1?fr=kg_hanyu). Among them, “Anthology of Ancient Chinese Writings” note book was marked “taught by Wu Jianzhai” on
top of its first page. Wu Jianzhai is Wu Chengshi, art name Jianzhai, is one of the three disciples of the prominent Sinology scholar Zhang Taiyan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Binglin). Wu is a renowned economist, ancient Chinese philologist, and educator. Together with Huang Kan
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Kan), he is called “Southern Huang and Northern Wu”. Between 1924 and 1933, Wu was employed as professor and head of the Chinese Department at Beijing Normal University. He was dedicated to teaching and ancient Chinese studies. Through the years, he offered many classes including History of Chinese Classics ( 经 学史, https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BB%8F%E5%AD%A6), “Ancient Ceremonies”, “Anthology of ancient Chinese Writings” , “Word formation” (六书条例 , https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%85%AD%E4%B9%A6/7841?fr=aladdin), and</p>

<p>“comparative method for reading ancient Chinese writings”. These three volumes have to be Wang Shuda’s class notes written in brush strokes during his college years. All the note books are made of Xuan Paper. Wang’s notes is very tidy and clear, the strokes is running smoothly and elegantly. Looking at the notes, one can imagine the depth of knowledge and the demeanor of Wu Chengshi when he was teaching, one can also feel the focus, the seriousness, and intelligence of Wang Shuda.</p>

<p>4、Zhang Yongquan recalls in My College《我的大学》
(http://hebtu.cuepa.cn/show_more.php?doc_id=1312448):</p>

<p>(During culture revolution) After many years of editing the Modern Chinese Dictionary (现 代汉语词典, https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8E%B0%E4%BB %A3%E6%B1%89%E8%AF%AD%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8), Mr. Wang Shuda was transferred from the Philosophical and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to the country side. However, his Ancient Chinese class was taught with utmost care，every word that contains real meaning, every form words, is explained meticulously.</p>
